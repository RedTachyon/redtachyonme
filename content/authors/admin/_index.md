      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

AI researcher, waiting to start my new position very soon.
Until recently, I was working at AI Redefined where I'm building tooling for human-in-the-loop RL. 
I got my PhD from École Polytechnique, my thesis topic was "Simulating Crowds with Reinforcement Learning". In the past I was at University of Warsaw, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and Aalto University.

In my free time, I'm the maintainer of Gymnasium (the official continuation of OpenAI Gym), sometimes reviewing other people's bugs, sometimes adding my own bugs... I mean, features. Sometimes I also help with PettingZoo, SuperSuit and other projects in the Farama Foundation.
